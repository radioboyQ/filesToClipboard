3) Click on the key for that extension. The 'Default' field will have an entry in it, such as txtfile or batfile. Copy the contents of that entry.
4) Make a copy of the AddFileType.reg file, and rename this copy to something you recognize.
5) Right-click your new file, and choose edit.
6) Replace the instances 'filetype' in your new file with the handler you copied from the registry editor earlier in step 3.
7) Save your changes to your new file.
